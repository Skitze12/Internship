            <h2>Steve Kamb</h2>
            <p>Joining SFC is the best decision that anyone wanting to get fit and lose weight could ever make.
                 I have joined conventional gyms in the past with little or no success, and the longest that I stayed a member was for 6 months.
                  When you go to the gym on your own you can not get results without paying large amounts of money for personal one to one training.
                 I have been with SFC now for nearly 18 months, and have achieved great results.  </p>

                <p >Since being at SFC I have done things I never dreamed I would do.
                     I have stepped so far out of my comfort zone I can no longer see it.
                      Anyone who knows me personally would know that 5 years ago I barely walked anywhere,
                       never mind ran. I did not own any trainers, I now practically live in gym gear on my days off work!
                     I have taken part in four 10K obstacle races, swam a mile of Windermere, done several running events and I am planning on many more. </div>
